# python-transpiler

since transpiling newer python code to work on older python versions requires type checking, and there isnt a good python type checker that's also written in python (mypy sucks), i decided to abandon this project.

if i ever revisit this idea, it will be part of basedpyright: https://github.com/DetachHead/basedpyright/issues/286
